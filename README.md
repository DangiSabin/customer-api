Customer API â€“ Spring Boot Docker Example
=========================================

This is a sample Spring Boot microservice to manage customer data via a REST API. It can be containerized and deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and integrated with CI/CD tools. Includes a CLI client and observability support.

This is not an official Google product.

Building
========
Regular Maven build:

    mvn package

Build Docker container:

    docker build -t customer-api .

Running
=======
Java
----
Run locally:

    mvn spring-boot:run

Docker
------
Run API container:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 customer-api

Docker Compose
--------------
Navigate to the project root and use Docker Compose:

    docker-compose up

Kubernetes
----------
The following assumes you have a Kubernetes cluster running (e.g., via Minikube).

Navigate to the Kubernetes config folder:

    cd k8s

Apply resources:

    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml

Expose the service using:

    minikube service customer-api-service

CI/CD
-----
CI/CD is defined via GitHub Actions. On push to main:

- Builds
- Runs tests
- Optionally deploys Docker image

See: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Google App Engine (Optional)
----------------------------
If deploying to GAE using gcloud CLI:

1. Configure your Redis host in:
    `src/main/resources/application-gae.properties`

2. Build the Docker image:

    mvn package
    docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/customer-api .

3. Deploy using gcloud:

    gcloud app deploy
